## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.2.x to 1.3.0

1. **Update agent invocation**: Use the new CLI tool for agent commands:

   ```bash
   # Old way
   npm run assess

   # New way
   npm run agent:invoke AUDITOR:assess-code -- --scope full
   ```

2. **Python support**: Ensure Python tooling is installed if working with Python code:

   ```bash
   pip install black ruff mypy pytest coverage
   ```

3. **New agent commands**: Familiarize yourself with the expanded agent commands:
   - Each agent now has 8-9 specific commands
   - Use `npm run agent:invoke --help` for command list
   - See `.claude/agents/CLAUDE.md` for complete documentation

4. **MCP server configuration**: Update `.claude/mcp.json` if customizing MCP servers

### Migrating from 1.1.x to 1.2.0

1. **Update file references**: All documentation files have been renamed to use kebab-case. Update any links or references in your code:

   ```diff
   - docs/AI Coding Assistant Development Protocol.md
   + docs/ai-development-protocol.md
   ```

2. **Update package.json scripts**: New scripts have been added for agent operations:

   ```bash
   npm run agents:init    # Initialize agents
   npm run pattern:extract # Extract patterns
   npm run fil:classify   # Classify changes
   ```

3. **New environment variables**: Add these to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   MAX_FIX_PACK_SIZE=300
   MIN_DIFF_COVERAGE=80
   MIN_MUTATION_SCORE=30
   ```

### Migrating from 1.0.x to 1.1.0

1. **Enable multi-agent system**: Configure agent roles in `.claude/settings.json`

2. **Set up Linear integration**: Add Linear API credentials to `.env`:

   ```bash
   LINEAR_API_KEY=your_key
   LINEAR_TEAM_ID=your_team
   LINEAR_PROJECT_ID=your_project
   ```

3. **Update CI/CD**: Add new GitHub Actions workflows from `.github/workflows/`
