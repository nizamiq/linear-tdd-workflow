# /cycle - Sprint/Cycle Planning Command

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Execution Patterns by Subcommand

This command uses different execution patterns depending on the subcommand:

### For `/cycle plan` and `/cycle status` (Analysis Mode):

Uses the **ORCHESTRATOR mode** where:

- **Main agent (PLANNER)** orchestrates workflow and makes decisions in main context
- **Worker subprocesses** perform READ-ONLY analysis tasks (fetch data, calculate metrics)
- **NO subprocess writes** - all Linear updates happen in main context

**Safe subprocess usage (READ-ONLY):**

- ‚úÖ Fetching Linear issues and cycles
- ‚úÖ Analyzing git history
- ‚úÖ Calculating metrics and scoring
- ‚úÖ Generating recommendations

**Prohibited in subprocesses (WRITE operations):**

- ‚ùå Creating Linear cycles
- ‚ùå Updating issue states
- ‚ùå Making git commits
- ‚ùå Creating PRs

**Rule:** Subprocesses return DATA, main context makes CHANGES.

### For `/cycle execute` (Execution Mode):

Uses **DIRECT mode** where:

- **Main agent (PLANNER)** performs work directly in main context
- **NO subprocess deployment** - all work happens in main context where changes persist
- **Direct tool usage** - Read, Write, Edit, Bash tools affect actual workspace
- **Real work is performed** - files are modified, PRs are created, tasks are updated

**Critical for `/cycle execute`:**

- ‚úÖ Use Read/Write/Edit tools directly to modify files
- ‚úÖ Use Bash commands directly to make git commits
- ‚úÖ Create PRs directly using available tools
- ‚úÖ Update Linear tasks directly with MCP
- ‚úÖ Verify work persists with actual tool output

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN for `/cycle execute`:**

- ‚ùå DO NOT use Task tool to spawn subagents for implementation work
- ‚ùå DO NOT provide "instructions and plans" instead of actual work
- ‚ùå DO NOT report "agents deployed" without real tool output
- ‚ùå DO NOT create theoretical implementation guides

**KEY DISTINCTION:**

- `/cycle plan` = Analyze and plan (READ-ONLY subprocess workers)
- `/cycle execute` = Direct execution in main context (NO subprocesses for work)

## Overview

Comprehensive cycle planning automation that analyzes backlog, calculates capacity, selects optimal work items, and prepares the team for sprint execution.

## ü§ñ Execution Instructions for Claude Code

When user invokes `/cycle [subcommand]`:

1. **Read command parameters** from user input
2. **DETERMINE EXECUTION MODE** based on subcommand:
   - `/cycle plan` or `/cycle status` ‚Üí Use **ORCHESTRATOR mode**
   - `/cycle execute` ‚Üí Use **DIRECT mode**
   - `/cycle review` ‚Üí Use **ORCHESTRATOR mode**
3. **EXECUTE ACCORDINGLY**:
   - **ORCHESTRATOR mode**: Invoke PLANNER agent via Task tool (spawns READ-ONLY workers)
   - **DIRECT mode**: Claude Code executes work directly using available tools
4. **Wait for results** and present to user
5. **Handle approval gates** only for Linear operations

**CRITICAL for `/cycle execute`:**
- DO NOT invoke PLANNER via Task tool (would create subprocess)
- Claude Code must execute work DIRECTLY using Read/Write/Edit/Bash tools
- Follow the DIRECT execution instructions in the PLANNER agent file

**DO NOT ask for permission** - Execute according to the determined mode.

## Usage

```bash
/cycle plan      # Run full 4-phase planning workflow
/cycle status    # Check current cycle health and metrics
/cycle execute   # Begin cycle execution with prepared work
/cycle review    # Post-cycle retrospective and learning
```

## Subcommands

### `/cycle plan`

Executes the complete 4-phase planning workflow:

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Linear State Analysis (10 min)**

- Current cycle velocity and health metrics
- Backlog composition and depth analysis
- Dependency mapping and blocker identification
- Team capacity calculation

**Phase 2: Intelligent Cycle Planning (15 min)**

- Multi-factor issue scoring algorithm
- Optimal work selection based on capacity
- Technical debt vs feature balancing (30/70)
- Risk mitigation prioritization

**Phase 3: Claude Code Work Alignment (10 min)**

- Work queue generation for agents
- Pre-implementation analysis
- Test coverage requirement mapping
- Task assignment optimization

**Phase 4: Execution Readiness (5 min)**

- CI/CD pipeline validation
- Environment configuration checks
- Quality gate verification
- Kickoff report generation

### `/cycle status`

Quick health check of current cycle:

- Progress against planned work
- Velocity tracking vs historical
- Blocker and risk identification
- Remaining capacity analysis

### `/cycle execute`

**DEPLOY SUBAGENTS IN MAIN CONTEXT - NOT SUBPROCESSES**

Deploy subagents that can persist work to the user's workspace:

1. **Retrieve current cycle** from Linear MCP
2. **Identify ready work items** (Backlog/Todo/Ready status)
3. **DEPLOY SUBAGENTS via Task tool** to execute work:
   - Use `Task({ subagent_type: "executor", ... })` for fixes
   - Use `Task({ subagent_type: "guardian", ... })` for CI/CD
   - Use `Task({ subagent_type: "auditor", ... })` for quality checks
4. **VERIFY subagent work** by checking actual tool output:
   - Files were actually created/modified
   - Git commits have real hashes
   - Tests actually pass/fail
   - Linear tasks actually updated
5. **REPORT ONLY VERIFIED WORK** - no simulations or analyses

**CRITICAL**: Subagents run in main context where their work persists, NOT in isolated subprocesses.

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:

- ‚ùå Reporting "analyses and simulations"
- ‚ùå Describing work without showing actual tool output
- ‚ùå Saying "agents were deployed" without actual Task tool results

### `/cycle review`

Post-cycle analysis and learning:

- Actual vs planned velocity
- Completed vs planned work
- Blocker impact analysis
- Pattern extraction for SCHOLAR

## Integration Points

### Linear

- Reads: Issues, cycles, projects, team members
- Writes: Issue updates, cycle composition, assignments

### GitHub

- Reads: PR history, code metrics, test coverage
- Writes: None (read-only for planning)

### CI/CD

- Reads: Pipeline status, test results, deployment history
- Writes: None (validation only)

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Insufficient Capacity**

```
Warning: Selected work (320h) exceeds capacity (280h)
Recommended actions:
1. Defer 2 low-priority items
2. Reduce scope of FEAT-234
3. Add team member capacity
```

**Blocked Dependencies**

```
Error: Critical path blocked by external team
Affected issues: TASK-123 ‚Üí TASK-456 ‚Üí TASK-789
Resolution: Escalating to Engineering Manager
```

**Linear API Limits**

```
Warning: Approaching API rate limit (950/1000)
Switching to cached data for non-critical queries
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run planning 2 days before cycle start**
   - Allows time for clarification
   - Enables pre-work preparation

2. **Review with team before execution**
   - Validate assignments
   - Confirm availability
   - Address concerns

3. **Monitor daily during cycle**
   - Track velocity trends
   - Identify blockers early
   - Adjust scope if needed

4. **Always run review after cycle**
   - Capture learnings
   - Update velocity calculations
   - Improve planning accuracy
