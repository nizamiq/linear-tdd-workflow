# Cycle Command Issues & Solutions

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: `/cycle plan` - Linear Issues Not Created/Updated

**Root Cause:**
- PLANNER completes analysis and generates plan report
- BUT: No explicit step to create Linear cycle or tasks
- Missing approval gate before Linear write operations
- Workflow ends at "plan generation" instead of "cycle creation"

**Evidence:**
- `cycle.md` has NO approval gate keywords
- PLANNER has Linear MCP access but doesn't use it for cycle creation
- Documentation says "PLANNER makes all state changes" but no implementation guidance

### Issue 2: `/cycle execute` - Subagents Not Persisting Work

**Root Cause:**
- PLANNER invokes subagents via Task tool (correct)
- BUT: Subagents receive vague instructions and analyze instead of execute
- Anti-hallucination protocols may be too strict
- No explicit WRITE permissions or clear execution instructions

**Evidence:**
- Subagents ARE invoked (architecture is correct)
- But prompts may be analysis-focused instead of execution-focused
- Missing verification that actual tool calls happened

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix `/cycle plan` Linear Task Creation

**Architecture Decision:**

Two options:

**Option A: PLANNER Creates Directly (Recommended)**
- ‚úÖ Simpler - one agent, one Linear connection
- ‚úÖ Faster - no agent handoff overhead
- ‚úÖ Clear ownership - PLANNER owns cycle planning end-to-end
- ‚ùå Violates STRATEGIST exclusivity principle slightly

**Option B: PLANNER ‚Üí STRATEGIST Handoff**
- ‚úÖ Maintains STRATEGIST as exclusive Linear manager
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: PLANNER plans, STRATEGIST executes
- ‚ùå More complex - requires agent coordination
- ‚ùå Slower - additional agent invocation

**Recommendation: Option A with Documentation Update**

Justification:
- PLANNER already has Linear MCP access for cycle operations
- Creating cycle/tasks is part of "cycle planning" workflow
- STRATEGIST remains exclusive manager for OTHER Linear operations (assessments, fixes, etc.)
- Performance and simplicity win

**Implementation:**

1. **Add Approval Gate to cycle.md:**

```markdown
### `/cycle plan`

**Phase 4.5: Linear Cycle Creation (Approval Gate)**

After generating the plan, PLANNER will:

1. **Present Plan** to user with selected work items
2. **ASK FOR APPROVAL**: "Would you like me to create this cycle in Linear?"
3. **On approval**:
   - Create Linear cycle using `mcp__linear-server__create_cycle()`
   - Add selected issues to cycle
   - Return cycle ID and Linear URL
4. **On rejection**: Save plan to file for manual review
```

2. **Add Implementation to planner.md:**

```javascript
// Phase 4.5: Create Linear Cycle (with approval)
async function createLinearCycle(selectedIssues, cycleData) {
  // Present plan summary
  console.log(`
üìã CYCLE PLAN READY
==================
Selected Issues: ${selectedIssues.length}
Estimated Effort: ${cycleData.totalEffort} hours
Technical Debt: ${cycleData.techDebtRatio}%

Would you like me to create this cycle in Linear? (yes/no)
  `);

  // Wait for approval (system will pause here)
  const approved = await getUserApproval();

  if (!approved) {
    console.log("‚ùå Cycle creation cancelled. Plan saved to docs/cycle-plan.json");
    return null;
  }

  // Create cycle in Linear
  const team = process.env.LINEAR_TEAM_ID || 'ACO';
  const cycle = await mcp__linear-server__create_cycle({
    team: team,
    name: cycleData.name,
    startsAt: cycleData.startsAt,
    endsAt: cycleData.endsAt,
  });

  // Add issues to cycle
  for (const issue of selectedIssues) {
    await mcp__linear-server__update_issue({
      id: issue.id,
      cycleId: cycle.id,
    });
  }

  console.log(`‚úÖ Created cycle: ${cycle.url}`);
  return cycle;
}
```

### Solution 2: Fix `/cycle execute` Subagent Persistence

**Architecture Decision:**

Problem is NOT the architecture - subagents CAN persist work.
Problem is EXECUTION: Subagents aren't being given clear WRITE instructions.

**Solution: Explicit Execution Instructions**

1. **Update cycle.md with explicit subagent prompts:**

```markdown
### `/cycle execute`

**Subagent Invocation Pattern:**

```javascript
// CORRECT: Explicit write instructions
Task({
  subagent_type: "executor",
  description: "Implement CLEAN-123",
  prompt: `
    IMMEDIATE EXECUTION REQUIRED:

    1. Read Linear task CLEAN-123 details
    2. Create feature branch: feature/CLEAN-123-description
    3. Write failing test (RED phase)
    4. Implement minimal code (GREEN phase)
    5. Refactor (REFACTOR phase)
    6. Commit with actual git commands
    7. Create PR with gh cli
    8. Return PR URL and commit hashes

    DO NOT analyze or plan - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY.
    Use Write/Edit/Bash tools to make actual changes.
    Verify all changes with git status, test output.
  `
});

// WRONG: Vague analysis-focused prompt
Task({
  subagent_type: "executor",
  description: "Fix CLEAN-123",
  prompt: "Analyze and implement the fix for CLEAN-123"  // ‚ùå TOO VAGUE
});
```
```

2. **Add Ground Truth Verification to planner.md:**

```javascript
// After deploying subagents, verify actual work
async function verifySubagentWork(taskResults) {
  const verifications = [];

  for (const result of taskResults) {
    // Verify files were actually modified
    const gitStatus = await Bash({ command: "git status --porcelain" });

    // Verify commits exist
    const gitLog = await Bash({ command: "git log --oneline -3" });

    // Verify PRs exist
    const prCheck = await Bash({ command: `gh pr view ${result.prNumber} --json url` });

    // Verify Linear tasks updated
    const linearTask = await mcp__linear-server__get_issue({ id: result.taskId });

    verifications.push({
      taskId: result.taskId,
      filesModified: gitStatus.includes(result.expectedFiles),
      commitExists: gitLog.includes(result.commitHash),
      prExists: prCheck.success,
      linearUpdated: linearTask.state.name === "In Progress",
    });
  }

  return verifications;
}
```

3. **Add Verification Step to cycle.md:**

```markdown
**Phase 5: Verification (CRITICAL)**

After subagent deployment:

1. **Wait for subagents to complete** (collect Task tool results)
2. **Verify actual work happened:**
   - `git log` shows new commits
   - `git status` shows clean working directory
   - `gh pr list` shows new PRs
   - Linear MCP shows tasks updated to "In Progress"
3. **Report ONLY verified work** with actual evidence
4. **Flag failures** if verification fails

**Example Verified Report:**

```
‚úÖ VERIFIED WORK COMPLETION

Task CLEAN-123:
- Commit: a1b2c3d (verified via git log)
- PR: #456 (verified via gh pr view)
- Linear: In Progress (verified via Linear MCP)
- Files: src/auth.ts modified (verified via git diff)

Task CLEAN-124:
- Commit: e4f5g6h
- PR: #457
- Linear: In Progress
- Files: src/api.ts modified
```
```

3. ‚úÖ Update troubleshooting guide:
   - Common issues with `/cycle plan`
   - Common issues with `/cycle execute`
   - Verification steps

## Best Practices & Stability

### Design Principles

1. **Clear Ownership**:
   - PLANNER owns cycle planning end-to-end (including Linear cycle creation)
   - STRATEGIST owns general Linear operations (assessments, fixes, releases)

2. **Explicit Over Implicit**:
   - Explicit approval gates for write operations
   - Explicit execution instructions for subagents
   - Explicit verification of actual work

3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**:
   - If approval not received, save plan but don't create cycle
   - If subagent fails, report failure (don't fabricate success)
   - If verification fails, flag the issue

4. **Ground Truth Verification**:
   - All work claims must be verified with tool output
   - Git operations verified with `git log`, `git status`
   - Linear operations verified with Linear MCP queries
   - PR operations verified with `gh` CLI

### Stability Measures

1. **Transaction Semantics**:
   - Create cycle first
   - Then add issues one by one
   - If failure, report partial success with cycle ID

2. **Error Recovery**:
   - If Linear cycle creation fails, save plan to file
   - If subagent fails, continue with remaining subagents
   - If verification fails, report which tasks succeeded/failed

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Batch Linear operations (update 5 issues at a time)
   - Add delays between operations (200ms)
   - Respect Linear API rate limits

4. **Rollback Capability**:
   - Keep cycle plan in version control
   - Enable manual cycle creation from saved plan
   - Enable manual cleanup of partially created cycles

2. Test with `/cycle plan` on non-production team
3. Verify Linear cycle creation works
4. Test with `/cycle execute` on small work item
5. Verify subagent persistence works
6. Roll out to production
