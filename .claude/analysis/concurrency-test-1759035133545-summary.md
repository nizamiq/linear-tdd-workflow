# Concurrency Analysis Report

## Test Overview
- **Test ID**: concurrency-test-1759035133545
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-28T04:52:13.545Z
- **System**: darwin arm64

## Key Findings

### Maximum Safe Concurrency
**5** concurrent agents can be safely executed

### Primary Bottlenecks
- sequential-thinking concurrency limits

### Recommendations
- Task tool can handle moderate concurrency - focus on coordination
- Address bottlenecks before scaling concurrency

## Detailed Results

### Task Tool Concurrency
- **1 agents**: ✅ Success (1137ms)
- **2 agents**: ✅ Success (1494ms)
- **3 agents**: ✅ Success (1461ms)
- **5 agents**: ✅ Success (1010ms)

### MCP Server Limits
- **linear-server**: Max 3 concurrent operations
- **sequential-thinking**: Max 2 concurrent operations

### Resource Usage
- Baseline memory: 4MB
- Memory scaling appears acceptable

## Next Steps
Based on these findings, the next phase should focus on:
1. Task tool can handle moderate concurrency - focus on coordination
1. Address bottlenecks before scaling concurrency
