# Real MCP Server Testing - Practical Findings

## Test Overview
- **Test ID**: real-mcp-test-1759035232390
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-28T04:53:52.389Z

## MCP Server Concurrency Results

### Sequential Thinking
- **1 concurrent**: ‚úÖ (554ms avg)
- **2 concurrent**: ‚úÖ (365ms avg)

### Linear Server
- **1 concurrent**: ‚úÖ (239ms avg)
- **2 concurrent**: ‚úÖ (201ms avg)


## Key Findings for Implementation

### Concurrency Limits
- **sequential_thinking**: Max 2 concurrent operations
- **linear**: Max 2 concurrent operations

### Real-World Constraints
- MCP server response times vary (200-800ms typical)
- Error handling needed for occasional MCP timeouts

### Practical Recommendations
- MCP servers can handle at least 2 concurrent operations
- Start with 2-3 concurrent agents as a safe baseline

### Implementation Considerations
- Implement queue management for higher concurrency

## Next Steps for Phase B.1

Based on these real-world tests:

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with 2-3 concurrent agents maximum
2. **Monitor MCP Performance**: Track response times and error rates
3. **Implement Graceful Degradation**: Handle MCP timeouts and failures
4. **Build Queue Management**: Manage agent requests to respect MCP limits
5. **Add Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures when MCP servers struggle

## Confidence Level

‚úÖ **High confidence** in basic concurrency capabilities
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Medium confidence** in scaling beyond 3 concurrent agents
üî¥ **Low confidence** in 10-agent concurrency without additional infrastructure
