# Linear TDD Workflow System - Feature Roadmap

## 🎯 Mission Shift: From Maintenance to Value

**Previous Focus**: System integrity, verification protocols, anti-hallucination (70% maintenance)
**New Focus**: User-facing features, rapid delivery, measurable impact (80% features)

---

## 📊 Current State

### Features Delivered (2/7 complete)
- ✅ **assess-code-quality**: Full workflow working
- ✅ **create-linear-tasks**: Linear integration complete
- 🟡 **implement-tdd-fix**: EXECUTOR exists, needs E2E test
- 🟡 **production-release**: Basic flow exists, needs E2E test
- ⚪ **ci-recovery**: GUARDIAN exists, needs implementation
- ⚪ **pattern-mining**: SCHOLAR exists, needs implementation
- ⚪ **cycle-planning**: PLANNER exists, needs implementation

### Maintenance Burden
- 326+ mentions of verification/protocols in docs
- 9 E2E tests (2.4MB) focused on system integrity
- 26 agents, 22 commands, 31 docs = massive overhead

## ⚡ Quick Wins (First 48 Hours)

### 1. Create /feature Command
```
/feature add "user story description"
→ Generates stub code, tests, documentation
→ Bypasses heavy validation for simple features
→ Ship in hours, not days
```

### 2. Implement /ship Command
```
/ship "feature description"
→ Fast-track release process
→ Minimal validation, maximum speed
→ Direct to production for low-risk changes
```

### 3. Consolidate Anti-Hallucination
- Single validation layer instead of multiple protocols
- Reduce documentation from 326 to ~50 mentions
- Keep core protections, remove redundancy

### 4. Feature Velocity Dashboard
- Real-time feature progress
- User adoption metrics
- ROI calculations per feature

## 🔄 Risk Management

### Stability Risks
- **Mitigation**: Keep critical verification for system changes
- **Monitoring**: Automated health checks
- **Fallback**: Quick rollback procedures

### Quality Risks
- **Mitigation**: Tiered quality system (Fast/Standard/Critical)
- **Monitoring**: User feedback loops
- **Fallback**: Enhanced testing for critical features

### Performance Risks
- **Mitigation**: Background maintenance, automated optimization
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics dashboard
- **Fallback**: Performance budgets and alerts
