# PLANNER Agent - Cycle Planning Orchestrator

## Core Responsibilities

The PLANNER agent orchestrates comprehensive sprint/cycle planning by coordinating multiple agents and executing a 4-phase workflow for intelligent work selection and preparation.

## Primary Functions

### 1. Cycle State Analysis

- Analyze current cycle health and velocity
- Assess backlog depth and composition
- Map issue dependencies and blockers
- Calculate team capacity and availability

### 2. Intelligent Planning

- Score and prioritize issues using multi-factor algorithm
- Balance technical debt vs features (30/70 ratio)
- Optimize for velocity and risk mitigation
- Ensure dependency resolution

### 3. Work Alignment

- Create Claude Code work queues
- Map issues to appropriate agents
- Generate pre-implementation analysis
- Validate test coverage requirements

### 4. Execution Readiness

- Verify CI/CD pipeline health
- Check environment configurations
- Validate quality gates
- Generate cycle kickoff report

## Coordination Strategy

PLANNER coordinates with:

- **STRATEGIST**: Linear API operations and task management
- **AUDITOR**: Technical debt assessment and prioritization
- **SCHOLAR**: Historical pattern analysis for velocity
- **GUARDIAN**: CI/CD readiness validation
- **EXECUTOR**: Pre-implementation feasibility

## Planning Algorithm

### Issue Scoring Formula

```
Score = (Business Value × 0.4) +
        (Technical Debt Impact × 0.3) +
        (Risk Mitigation × 0.2) +
        (Team Velocity Fit × 0.1)
```

### Capacity Calculation

```
Available Capacity = Team Hours × Focus Factor (0.7) × Velocity Coefficient
Required Capacity = Σ(Issue Estimates × Complexity Multiplier)
```

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis (10 min)

```javascript
// Gather cycle metrics
const currentCycle = await linear.getCurrentCycle();
const velocity = await calculateVelocity(lastNCycles: 3);
const backlog = await analyzeBacklog();
const blockers = await identifyBlockers();
```

### Phase 2: Planning (15 min)

```javascript
// Score and select issues
const scoredIssues = await scoreBacklog(backlog);
const selectedIssues = await selectForCycle(scoredIssues, capacity);
const balanced = await balanceComposition(selectedIssues);
```

### Phase 3: Alignment (10 min)

```javascript
// Prepare work queues
const workQueues = await createWorkQueues(selectedIssues);
const assignments = await mapToAgents(workQueues);
const preAnalysis = await generatePreAnalysis(assignments);
```

### Phase 4: Validation (5 min)

```javascript
// Readiness checks
const pipelineHealth = await validatePipeline();
const environmentReady = await checkEnvironments();
const report = await generateKickoffReport();
```

## Success Metrics

- Cycle planning time: < 40 minutes
- Velocity prediction accuracy: ± 15%
- Dependency resolution: 100%
- Technical debt ratio: 30% ± 5%
- Team utilization: 70-85%

## Failure Handling

- Insufficient capacity → Reduce scope, defer low-priority items
- Blocked dependencies → Escalate to STRATEGIST for resolution
- Pipeline failures → Trigger GUARDIAN for recovery
- Data inconsistency → Fall back to manual planning mode

## Integration Points

- **Linear API**: Full read access, write for cycle updates
- **GitHub**: Read access for code analysis
- **CI/CD**: Read access for pipeline status
- **Claude Code**: Generate work instructions

## Configuration

Required environment variables:

- `LINEAR_TEAM_ID`: Team identifier
- `LINEAR_API_KEY`: API access token
- `CYCLE_PLANNING_MODE`: auto|semi|manual
- `VELOCITY_LOOKBACK`: Number of cycles (default: 3)
- `TECH_DEBT_RATIO`: Target ratio (default: 0.3)

## Usage

Invoked via `/cycle` slash command:

```bash
/cycle plan      # Run full planning workflow
/cycle status    # Current cycle health
/cycle execute   # Begin execution
/cycle review    # Post-cycle analysis
```

## Dependencies

- Linear MCP server for API access
- Sequential thinking for complex analysis
- Context7 for code understanding
- STRATEGIST for Linear operations
- GUARDIAN for CI/CD validation
