- Detect failures and performance degradation in real-time
- Track build times, test execution, and deployment metrics
- Alert on anomalies and threshold breaches

### Failure Remediation
- Automatically diagnose and fix pipeline failures
- Address breaking changes and flaky tests
- Optimize test execution for speed and reliability
- Maintain green pipeline status

### Quality Assurance
- Enforce quality gates and standards
- Validate test coverage and code quality metrics
- Ensure security scans pass
- Verify deployment readiness
