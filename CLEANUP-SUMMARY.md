# Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: September 29, 2025

### Phase 2: .claude Directory Cleanup

## Summary

Cleaned up the `.claude` directory by removing 33 obsolete files, reducing from 105 to 72 files. All development artifacts, test files, backup files, and obsolete implementations have been archived.

### .claude Directory Cleanup

#### Backup Files (→ `/archive/claude-obsolete/backup-files/`)

- 13 backup files (.bak, .bak2, .backup) from scripts/core/
- Including: agent-pool, concurrency-orchestrator, concurrency-tester, mcp-validator, etc.

#### Test/Development Files (→ `/archive/claude-obsolete/test-files/`)

- phase-b1-tester.js - Phase B1 development testing
- concurrency-tester.js - Concurrency testing utility
- real-mcp-tester.js - MCP testing utility
- test-linear-mcp.js - Linear integration testing
- test-tdd-enforcer.js - TDD enforcer testing

#### Phase Development (→ `/archive/claude-obsolete/phase-development/`)

- phase-b0-comprehensive-findings.md
- phase-b1-implementation-summary.md
- concurrency-test-\*.json and summary files
- real-mcp-test-\*.json and findings files

#### Old Workflows (→ `/archive/claude-obsolete/old-workflows/`)

- simple-workflow-kickoff.sh - Replaced by journeys
- workflow-kickoff.sh - Replaced by journeys
- vision-alignment-validator.js - Development validation tool
- real-multi-agent-workflow.js - Replaced by journey system

#### Obsolete Routers (→ `/archive/claude-obsolete/obsolete-routers/`)

- emergency-minimal-router.js - Emergency workaround
- memory-optimized-router.js - Replaced by journeys
- memory-safe-router.js - Replaced by journeys
- real-agent-orchestrator.js - Replaced by journey orchestration

#### Local Files (→ `/archive/claude-obsolete/local-files/`)

- settings.local.json - Local override configuration

### Phase 1: Root Directory Cleanup

### Files Moved to Archive

#### Root Directory Scripts (→ `/archive/root-scripts/`)

- `self-improvement-workflow.js` - Old workflow testing script
- `test-memory-safe-router.js` - Memory testing script
- `validate-fixes.js` - Fix validation script
- `validate-memory-fix.js` - Memory fix validation script

#### API Documentation (→ `/archive/api-docs/`)

- 269 API documentation JSON files from `docs/api/`
- These were auto-generated snapshots that accumulated over time

#### Report Files (→ `/archive/reports/`)

- 300 architecture analysis JSON files
- 273 refactoring analysis JSON files
- These were automated reports that can be regenerated as needed

#### Scripts Directory (→ `/archive/scripts/`)

- Old Linear Python scripts (`create_linear_*.py`, `test_linear_*.py`)
- Shell scripts (`*.sh`) - replaced by Makefile and journeys

### Updated Files

#### `.gitignore`

Added patterns to prevent accumulation of:

- Archive directory
- Generated JSON reports
- Root-level test scripts
- Assessment outputs
- Journey-generated directories

### Project Structure After Cleanup

```
.
├── .claude/           # Claude agent system
│   ├── agents/       # Agent definitions
│   ├── journeys/     # Autonomous journeys (JR-1 to JR-6)
│   └── cli.js        # Main CLI interface
├── Makefile          # Universal command interface
├── tests/            # Organized test suites
├── scripts/          # Essential operational scripts only
├── docs/             # Documentation (cleaned)
├── reports/          # Report structure (JSON files gitignored)
└── archive/          # Obsolete files for reference
```

### What Was Kept

- **Essential Scripts**: Core operational scripts in `/scripts/`
- **Documentation**: All markdown documentation in `/docs/`
- **Test Suites**: Organized test files in `/tests/`
- **Configuration**: All config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- **Claude System**: Complete `.claude/` directory with agents and journeys

### Recommendations

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Run `make clean` periodically to remove generated files
2. **Use Journeys**: Use the journey system for assessments instead of ad-hoc scripts
3. **Archive Policy**: Move obsolete files to `/archive/` rather than deleting
4. **Report Management**: Reports are now gitignored - only structure is tracked

### Space Saved

- Removed ~850+ generated JSON files from tracking
- Cleaned up root directory clutter
- Organized scripts into appropriate directories

```

**Before cleanup:** 105 files
**After cleanup:** 72 files
**Files archived:** 33 files

The `.claude` directory is now clean and focused on production-ready components, with all development artifacts and obsolete implementations properly archived.

The project is now cleaner and more maintainable while preserving all essential functionality.
