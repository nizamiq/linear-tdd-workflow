# Linear Cycle Planning & Work Alignment Report

## Executive Summary
Date: 2025-09-27
Team: a-coders (ACO)
Project: ai-coding

## Status Overview

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Linear API Connection Established**
   - Successfully connected to Linear API
   - Authenticated with API key
   - Verified team and project access

2. **Team & Project Configuration**
   - Team: a-coders (ACO)
   - Project: ai-coding (0% progress)
   - Project ID: 060d8a2f...
   - Team ID: 51db95b6...

3. **Scripts Created**
   - `linear_cycle_planning.py` - Comprehensive cycle planning and analysis
   - `create_linear_cycles.py` - Cycle creation utility
   - `test_linear_connection.py` - API connection testing
   - `create_linear_issues.py` - Issue creation from PRD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations Discovered
1. **Sub-team Cycle Limitation**
   - The a-coders team is configured as a sub-team in Linear
   - Sub-teams cannot create or manage cycles
   - This is a Linear platform limitation

### üìã Workaround Strategy

Since cycles cannot be created for sub-teams, we can still achieve effective sprint planning using:

#### 1. **Milestone-Based Planning**
   - Use Linear Milestones instead of cycles for sprint tracking
   - Create 2-week milestone periods
   - Assign issues to milestones for sprint planning

#### 2. **Project Views**
   - Use the ai-coding project to group and track work
   - Create custom views for sprint periods
   - Filter by date ranges for sprint tracking

#### 3. **Label-Based Sprints**
   - Create sprint labels (e.g., "sprint-2025-09-27")
   - Tag issues with appropriate sprint labels
   - Use label filters for sprint boards

#### 4. **Manual Sprint Tracking**
   - Create sprint planning issues as documentation
   - Track velocity manually in planning issues
   - Use comments for daily standups and updates

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Request Team Configuration Change
Ask the Linear workspace admin to:
- Convert a-coders to a parent team, OR
- Create cycles at the parent team level that a-coders can use

### Option 2: Implement Milestone-Based Planning
1. Create milestones for sprint periods
2. Assign issues to milestones
3. Use milestone views for sprint boards

### Option 3: Continue with Label-Based Management
1. Create sprint labels
2. Tag issues appropriately
3. Use filtered views for sprint tracking

## Available Linear Resources

### Teams in Workspace
- **a-coders** (ACO) - Current team [Sub-team]
- **fxml4** (FXM)
- **document-processor** (DOC)
- **NizamIQ** (NIZ)
- **Magure** (MAG)
- **Meridian Prime** (MP)

### Project Status
- **ai-coding**: 0% complete, assigned to a-coders and NizamIQ teams

## Scripts Available for Use

### 1. Issue Creation
```bash
python scripts/create_linear_issues_complete.py
```
Creates issues from PRD with proper hierarchy and labels.

### 2. API Testing
```bash
python scripts/test_linear_connection.py
```
Verifies API connection and lists available resources.

### 3. Cycle Planning (Modified for Milestones)
```bash
python scripts/linear_cycle_planning.py
```
Can be modified to work with milestones instead of cycles.

## Technical Analysis

### API Capabilities Confirmed
- ‚úÖ Team queries
- ‚úÖ Project queries  
- ‚úÖ Issue creation
- ‚úÖ Issue updates
- ‚úÖ Label management
- ‚úÖ State management
- ‚ùå Cycle creation (sub-team limitation)

### GraphQL Schema Notes
- Team ID type: String!
- Cycle management requires parent team
- Issues can be organized without cycles
- Milestones are available as alternative

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create Sprint Planning Issues**
   - Use issues to document sprint plans
   - Track velocity and progress manually
   - Link related work items

2. **Implement Label System**
   ```
   Labels to create:
   - sprint-current
   - sprint-next
   - sprint-2025-09-27
   - sprint-2025-10-11
   ```

3. **Set Up Views**
   - Create filtered views for current sprint
   - Set up backlog view
   - Configure team velocity tracking

### Long-term Strategy
1. Discuss with workspace admin about team structure
2. Consider moving to a parent team if cycles are critical
3. Implement custom tooling for sprint management if needed

## Conclusion

While we cannot create traditional cycles due to Linear's sub-team limitations, we have successfully:
- Established API connectivity
- Created comprehensive planning tools
- Identified viable workarounds
- Prepared alternative sprint management strategies

The project can proceed with milestone or label-based sprint management until the team structure can be adjusted or a parent team cycle can be utilized.
