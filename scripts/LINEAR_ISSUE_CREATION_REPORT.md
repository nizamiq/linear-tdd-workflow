## 💡 Recommendations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Use TypeScript/Node.js 20** for main implementation
2. **Implement XState** for agent state management
3. **Deploy PostgreSQL + pgvector** for Evidence Store
4. **Use BullMQ** for job processing
5. **Integrate OpenTelemetry** from the start

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Start with Fix Packs** to ensure safety
2. **Implement comprehensive testing** before any auto-fix
3. **Build rollback mechanisms** first
4. **Create kill switches** for all agents
5. **Monitor costs** from day one

### Team Structure
1. **Phase 0 Lead**: Infrastructure specialist
2. **Agent Development**: 2-3 engineers per agent
3. **DevOps/SRE**: Dedicated pipeline guardian
4. **QA**: TDD enforcement specialist
