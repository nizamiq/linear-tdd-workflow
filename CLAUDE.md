## üöÄ Linear TDD Workflow System Detected

This project has the **Linear TDD Workflow System v1.4.0** installed - a multi-agent autonomous code quality management system with functional release gates.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Verify system is active
test -d .claude && echo "‚úÖ System Available" || echo "‚ùå Not found"

# View complete documentation
cat .claude/CLAUDE.md

# Get started
make onboard
```

### Primary Commands

**Core Workflow:**
- `/assess` - Scan code quality and generate task definitions
- `/linear` - Create Linear tasks from assessment
- `/fix <TASK-ID>` - Implement fix with TDD enforcement
- `/release <version>` - Manage production release with functional gate
- `/status` - Current workflow and Linear status

**Specialized:**
- `/recover` - Auto-fix broken CI/CD pipeline
- `/cycle plan` - Sprint planning
- `/docs` - Documentation validation
- `/python` - Python optimization
- `/typescript` - TypeScript development
- `/deploy` - Progressive deployment

**Alternative access:** `make assess`, `make fix TASK=CLEAN-123`, `make release`

### Critical Constraints

‚ö†Ô∏è **Test-Driven Development is NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Every change follows RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR cycle
- ‚â•80% diff coverage required
- ‚â•30% mutation score required
- EXECUTOR agent enforces automatically

üéØ **Functional Release Gate**
- Only features with passing E2E tests can be released
- Registry tracks: `implemented` (‚úÖ allows), `partial` (‚ùå blocks), `planned` (‚ö™ neutral)
- Check readiness: `npm run release:validate-functional`
- Gate runs automatically in release journey Phase 2.5

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Testing
npm test                     # All tests with coverage
npm test:watch              # Watch mode for TDD
npm test:e2e                # End-to-end tests

# Quality
npm run lint                # Lint and auto-fix
npm run typecheck           # Type checking
npm run precommit           # Pre-commit checks

# Functional Release
npm run release:validate-functional   # Check release readiness
npm run release:user-stories          # View E2E coverage
npm run release:add-story             # Add feature to registry

# Cycle Planning
npm run cycle:full          # Complete sprint planning

# Agent Operations
npm run assess              # Code assessment
npm run execute:fixpack     # Execute approved fixes
```
