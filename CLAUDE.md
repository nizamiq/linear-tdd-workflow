## Project Context

**Linear TDD Workflow System** - Multi-agent autonomous code quality management system that enforces strict Test-Driven Development.

Linear Configuration:
- Team: Configured via `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` environment variable
- Project: Configured via `LINEAR_PROJECT_ID` environment variable (optional)
- Task Prefix: Configured via `LINEAR_TASK_PREFIX` environment variable (optional)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NON-NEGOTIABLE: Test-Driven Development

**Every code change follows strict TDD. This is enforced automatically.**

```
[RED] ‚Üí [GREEN] ‚Üí [REFACTOR]
  ‚Üì         ‚Üì           ‚Üì
Test    Minimal    Improve
First     Code     Design
```

### Quality Gates (Blocking - CI Fails If Not Met)
- **‚â•80% diff coverage** - Every changed line must be tested
- **‚â•30% mutation score** - Tests must validate actual behavior
- **NO production code without failing test first** - Zero exceptions

### The EXECUTOR Agent Enforces TDD

When you run `/fix CLEAN-XXX`, the EXECUTOR agent automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Refuses to write production code before tests exist
2. ‚úÖ Verifies RED phase (test fails for expected reason)
3. ‚úÖ Verifies GREEN phase (minimal code to pass)
4. ‚úÖ Verifies REFACTOR phase (improvements with passing tests)
5. ‚úÖ Checks coverage gates (‚â•80% diff, ‚â•30% mutation)
6. ‚úÖ Blocks commits that don't meet quality standards
7. ‚úÖ Labels commits with TDD phase: [RED], [GREEN], [REFACTOR]

**You cannot bypass this. It's built into the system.**

### TDD Quick Reference

**[RED Phase]** - Write failing test FIRST:
```javascript
test('calculates tax for high income', () => {
  expect(calculateTax(100000)).toBe(25000);
});
// ‚ùå FAILS - calculateTax doesn't exist yet
```

**[GREEN Phase]** - Minimal code to pass:
```javascript
function calculateTax(income) {
  return income * 0.25;
}
// ‚úÖ PASSES
```

**[REFACTOR Phase]** - Improve design:
```javascript
const TAX_RATE = 0.25;
function calculateTax(income) {
  validateIncome(income);
  return income * TAX_RATE;
}
// ‚úÖ STILL PASSES - refactored safely
```

## üéØ The Simplicity Principle (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT**: Following Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents" guidance, always prefer the **simplest approach** that achieves quality targets.

### Decision Hierarchy

```
1. Direct Tool Call  ‚Üí  2. Workflow  ‚Üí  3. Autonomous Agent
   (simplest, fastest)   (when needed)     (last resort)
```

**Cost/Complexity Impact**:
- Direct call: ~1x cost, 100% deterministic, instant
- Workflow: ~2-5x cost, 100% deterministic (if well-specified), fast
- Agent: ~10-20x cost, 70-95% reliable, slow (LLM latency)

**Decision Matrix**: See `.claude/docs/DECISION-MATRIX.md` for comprehensive guide on when to use each approach.

### Quick Rules

**Use Direct Tool Call** (via hooks or bash) for:
‚úÖ Linting (`npm run lint` via hook)
‚úÖ Type checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
‚úÖ Running tests (`npm test`)
‚úÖ Formatting (`prettier --write`)

**Use Workflow** (deterministic orchestration) for:
‚úÖ TDD cycle (RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR defined steps)
‚úÖ Multi-phase validation (lint + typecheck + tests in sequence)
‚úÖ Parallel batch operations (multiple independent assessments)

**Use Agent** (autonomous loop) only for:
‚úÖ Unpredictable complexity (code quality assessment)
‚úÖ Requires judgment (fix implementation, architecture decisions)
‚úÖ Adaptive planning (pipeline recovery, pattern learning)

**Available Workflows**:
- `.claude/workflows/lint-workflow.yaml` - Replaces LINTER agent (95% cost reduction)
- `.claude/workflows/typecheck-workflow.yaml` - Replaces TYPECHECKER agent (95% cost reduction)
- `.claude/workflows/validation-workflow.yaml` - Replaces VALIDATOR agent (90% cost reduction)

## Parallel Execution Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: This system supports parallel subagent execution for maximum efficiency. When working with multiple independent tasks, leverage Claude Code's Task tool to run up to 10 subagents concurrently.

### How to Execute Agents in Parallel

**Critical Rule**: Send **a single message with multiple Task tool calls** to run subagents in parallel.

**Example - Parallel Assessment**:
```
User: "Assess the entire codebase"

You: I'll assess 3 areas in parallel for speed:
[In ONE message, make 3 Task tool calls:]
- Task 1: Assess backend (src/api/**)
- Task 2: Assess frontend (src/ui/**)
- Task 3: Assess tests (tests/**)

[All 3 run concurrently, results merge after completion]
Total time: ~10 minutes (vs ~30 minutes sequential)
```

**Example - Parallel Fix Implementation**:
```
User: "Implement these 5 Linear tasks"

You: I'll implement all 5 fixes in parallel:
[In ONE message, make 5 Task tool calls:]
- Task 1: Fix CLEAN-123
- Task 2: Fix CLEAN-124
- Task 3: Fix CLEAN-125
- Task 4: Fix CLEAN-126
- Task 5: Fix CLEAN-127

[All 5 run concurrently]
Total time: ~15 minutes (vs ~75 minutes sequential)
```

### Key Principles

1. **Single message = Parallel** - Multiple Task calls in one message run concurrently
2. **Multiple messages = Sequential** - Each message waits for the previous to complete
3. **Maximum 10 concurrent subagents** - Claude Code's limit
4. **Independent scopes only** - No shared file writes between parallel agents
5. **Result merging** - Wait for all completions, then aggregate results

### When to Use Parallel Execution

**‚úÖ Use parallel execution for:**
- Assessing multiple directories/files independently
- Implementing multiple independent fix packs
- Running different types of validation (security, types, tests, lint)
- Analyzing separate modules or services
- Processing batch operations (multiple PRs, multiple issues)

**‚ùå Don't use parallel for:**
- Tasks with dependencies (A depends on B's output)
- Shared file modifications (merge conflicts)
- Sequential workflows (RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR must be ordered)
- Single large tasks that can't be split

### Performance Benefits

- **5-10x faster** execution for independent tasks
- **Better resource utilization** - max out 10-subagent limit
- **Reduced wait time** - no idle periods between tasks
- **Scalable** - handles large codebases efficiently

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The system operates through 23 specialized agents coordinated via Linear.app:

**Agent Usage:**
Claude Code natively discovers and uses agents through:
- **Slash Commands**: `/assess`, `/fix`, `/recover`, `/learn`, `/release`, `/status`, `/cycle`, `/docs`
- **Agent Files**: `.claude/agents/*.md` - Each agent has comprehensive system prompts
- **Direct Invocation**: Agents are automatically selected based on the task

**Agent Documentation:**
- `.claude/agents/` - All agent definitions in Markdown with frontmatter
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash command definitions
- Each agent file contains complete role description and capabilities

### Linear Task Management

**STRATEGIST is the EXCLUSIVE Linear MCP manager**. Linear integration follows delegation pattern:

**Permission Model**:
- **STRATEGIST**: ONLY agent with `linear-server` MCP access - manages all Linear operations
- **AUDITOR**: Generates Linear task definitions (in `linear_tasks` array) ‚Üí delegates to STRATEGIST
- **DOC-KEEPER**: Generates doc task definitions ‚Üí delegates to STRATEGIST
- **GUARDIAN**: Reports incidents ‚Üí STRATEGIST creates INCIDENT-XXX tasks
- **EXECUTOR**: Implements fixes ‚Üí STRATEGIST updates task status and links PRs
- **All Others**: No direct Linear access - work through STRATEGIST

**IMPORTANT**: No agent except STRATEGIST can call `mcp__linear-server__*` tools. This prevents permission conflicts and ensures consistent task management.

**Workflow**:
1. Agent completes work (e.g., AUDITOR finishes assessment)
2. Agent provides structured output with task definitions
3. STRATEGIST reads output and creates Linear tasks via MCP
4. User receives Linear task IDs for implementation

When in doubt about Linear operations, use STRATEGIST.

### Key Workflows

1. **Assessment ‚Üí Linear ‚Üí Execution**
   - AUDITOR scans code ‚Üí generates task definitions ‚Üí STRATEGIST creates Linear tasks ‚Üí EXECUTOR implements fixes

2. **TDD Enforcement (RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR)**
   - Every change must: write failing test ‚Üí minimal code to pass ‚Üí refactor
   - Enforced by CI: diff coverage ‚â•80%, mutation testing ‚â•30%

3. **Fix Pack Constraints**
   - Max 300 LOC per PR
   - Pre-approved changes only (FIL-0/FIL-1)
   - Atomic commits with rollback plans

## Critical Constraints

### Test-Driven Development
**Mandatory cycle for every change:**
1. **[RED]** - Write failing test first
2. **[GREEN]** - Minimal code to pass
3. **[REFACTOR]** - Improve with passing tests

### Fix Pack Limits
- ‚â§300 LOC per PR
- Diff coverage ‚â•80%
- Only FIL-0/FIL-1 changes (no feature work)

### Feature Impact Levels (FIL)
- **FIL-0/1**: Auto-approved (formatting, dead code, renames)
- **FIL-2**: Tech Lead approval (utilities, configs)
- **FIL-3**: Tech Lead + Product approval (APIs, migrations)

## Performance SLAs
- Code assessment: ‚â§12min for 150k LOC (JS/TS)
- Fix implementation: ‚â§15min p50
- Pipeline recovery: ‚â§10min p95

## MCP Tools Available
- `sequential-thinking` - Complex reasoning
- `context7` - Code understanding
- `linear` - Task management
- `playwright` - E2E testing
- `kubernetes` - Deployment

## Testing Framework

- **Framework**: Jest with TypeScript
- **Coverage Requirements**: 80% minimum
- **Test Organization**:
  - `tests/unit/` - Isolated component tests
  - `tests/integration/` - Component interaction
  - `tests/e2e/` - Full user journeys

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Follow TDD cycle strictly
3. Run `npm run precommit` before pushing
4. Create PR with diff coverage ‚â•80%
5. Merge to `develop` after review

GitFlow branches:
- `main` - Production releases only
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

## üéØ Functional Release Management

**Critical Concept**: Only release features that are truly functional and validated via E2E tests.

### User Story Registry
All features tracked in `.claude/user-stories/registry.yaml` with three statuses:
- **`implemented`**: Feature built + E2E test passing ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Allows release**
- **`partial`**: Feature built but NO E2E test ‚Üí ‚ùå **BLOCKS release**
- **`planned`**: Not yet built ‚Üí ‚ö™ Doesn't affect release

### Functional Release Gate
Automated validator (Phase 2.5 in release journey) that:
1. ‚úÖ Checks all `implemented` features have E2E tests
2. ‚úÖ Runs all E2E tests to verify they pass
3. ‚ùå **BLOCKS** release if any `partial` status features exist
4. ‚ùå **BLOCKS** release if any E2E test fails

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check if ready for release
npm run release:validate-functional

# View current coverage
npm run release:user-stories

# Add new feature to registry
npm run release:add-story

# Validate E2E test metadata
npm run e2e:validate
```

### Release Workflow
1. **Build feature** with TDD (RED‚ÜíGREEN‚ÜíREFACTOR)
2. **Add to registry** with `status: planned`
3. **Write E2E test** simulating user story with `@feature` tag
4. **Update registry** to `status: implemented` with `e2e_test` path
5. **Verify tests pass**: `npm test:e2e`
6. **Run release**: `/release 1.2.0` (gate runs automatically in Phase 2.5)

**If gate blocks**: Fix missing E2E tests, update registry, re-run validation.

**Documentation**: `.claude/docs/FUNCTIONAL-RELEASE.md` - Complete guide

## Agent-Specific Notes

When working with agents:
1. Check `.claude/agents/CLAUDE.md` for detailed specifications
2. Use standardized CLI invocation syntax
3. All agent PRs require human review
4. Agents operate in development/staging only (no production access)

## Linear Integration

**Primary Integration: MCP Tools + GitHub CLI** (No infrastructure needed!)

The system uses Claude Code's built-in tools for seamless integration:
- **Linear MCP Server** - Direct API access to Linear.app
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - Direct GitHub operations
- **No webhooks needed** - Works immediately in Claude Code

### Integration Modes
- **üü¢ Standard (Recommended)** - MCP tools + CLI (zero setup)
- **üü° Polling** - Scheduled sync for CI/CD
- **üî¥ Webhooks** - Advanced/Enterprise only (see `.claude/advanced/webhooks/`)

For details, see `.claude/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

### How It Works
Tasks are managed via STRATEGIST delegation pattern:
- Assessment results ‚Üí AUDITOR generates task definitions ‚Üí STRATEGIST creates Linear issues via MCP
- Fix Packs ‚Üí Linear tasks with estimates (created by STRATEGIST)
- PR status ‚Üí STRATEGIST updates Linear via MCP + GitHub CLI

**Always check Linear for task context before implementing fixes.**

**To create Linear tasks after assessment**:
```bash
# Quick command (auto-detects latest assessment)
/linear

# Or specify file explicitly
/linear proposals/issues-TIMESTAMP.json

# Alternative: Direct STRATEGIST invocation
/invoke STRATEGIST:create-linear-tasks proposals/issues-TIMESTAMP.json

# Fallback for CI/CD (no MCP available)
.claude/scripts/linear/create-tasks-from-assessment.sh proposals/issues-TIMESTAMP.json
```
- This system must support python development
- you need to ensure that all the aspects of the workflows are working properly with proper E2E testing! you can use this workflow to self improve this project!
