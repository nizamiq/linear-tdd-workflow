## System Interfaces

### storage

- **Type**: DATABASE
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Methods**: N/A
- **Authentication**: Required

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure Requirements

- Load Balancer: High availability setup
- Application Servers: Auto-scaling group
- Database: Single instance
- Cache: Redis cluster
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

### Environment Configuration
