## Remaining Issues

### Needs Manual Attention
1. **GitHub repository URL** - Line 55 needs actual repository URL
2. **GitHub organization** - Line 213 placeholder needs real org name
3. **Copyright holder** - LICENSE file needs actual entity name
4. **Support email** - Consider adding contact information
5. **Slack workspace link** - If available, add community link

### Future Improvements Recommended
1. Consider adding architecture diagram as an image
2. Add screenshots of Linear integration in action
3. Create video walkthrough for Quick Start
4. Add testimonials or case studies section
5. Consider version-specific documentation branches
