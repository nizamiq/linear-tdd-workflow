# Linear.app User Story & Issue Extraction Framework

## Objective
Extract and structure a comprehensive set of issues from the provided project vision, codebase, and documentation in a format optimized for Linear.app import and workflow management.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Analysis and Discovery
1. **Context Analysis**: Examine provided materials to identify:
   - Core objectives and deliverables
   - User personas and teams involved
   - Technical architecture and system boundaries
   - Existing implementation status
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Linear workspace structure (teams, projects, cycles)

2. **Issue Identification**: Extract issues covering:
   - **Features**: User-facing functionality
   - **Tasks**: Technical work and enablers
   - **Bugs**: Defects and issues to fix
   - **Improvements**: Performance, UX, and technical debt
   - **Spikes**: Research and investigation tasks

### Phase 2: Linear-Optimized Structure
Format each issue with Linear-specific fields:

```
TITLE: [Concise, action-oriented title]
DESCRIPTION:
  User Story Format (when applicable):
  As a [persona/role]
  I want [functionality]
  So that [value/outcome]

  Context: [Additional background]
  
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
  - [ ] Criterion 1
  - [ ] Criterion 2
  - [ ] Criterion 3
```

### Phase 3: Linear Metadata Assignment
Assign Linear-compatible metadata:

1. **Priority Levels** (Linear standard):
   - ðŸ”´ Urgent (P0): Blocking/Critical
   - ðŸŸ  High (P1): Important, do soon
   - ðŸŸ¡ Medium (P2): Important, not urgent
   - ðŸ”µ Low (P3): Nice to have
   - âšª None (P4): Backlog

2. **Estimates** (Linear points):
   - 1 point: Few hours
   - 2 points: Half day
   - 3 points: Full day
   - 5 points: 2-3 days
   - 8 points: Week
   - 13+ points: Should be broken down

3. **Labels** (organize with):
   - Type: `feature`, `bug`, `task`, `improvement`, `spike`
   - Area: `frontend`, `backend`, `api`, `database`, `infrastructure`
   - State: `mvp`, `post-mvp`, `tech-debt`, `blocked`
   - Team: `engineering`, `design`, `product`, `devops`

### Phase 4: Output Generation

#### Linear API JSON Format

      },
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        {

        }
      ],
      "custom_fields": {
        "story_points": number,
        "mvp": boolean,
        "epic": "string",
        "component": "string"
      },
      "github": {
        "branch_name": "string",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 5: Linear Workflow Optimization

#### Issue Hierarchy
Structure for Linear's parent-child relationships:
```
Epic (Parent Issue)
â”œâ”€â”€ Feature Story 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task 1.1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task 1.2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Bug Fix 1.3
â”œâ”€â”€ Feature Story 2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Task 2.1
â””â”€â”€ Technical Debt Item
```

#### Cycle Planning
Group issues by suggested cycles:
- **Cycle 1 (MVP)**: Critical path items
- **Cycle 2-3**: Core features
- **Cycle 4+**: Enhancements and optimizations
- **Backlog**: Future considerations

#### Team Assignment Suggestions
Based on issue type and area:
- Frontend Team: UI/UX issues
- Backend Team: API and data issues
- Platform Team: Infrastructure and DevOps
- QA Team: Testing and validation tasks

## Quality Criteria for Linear
- âœ“ Titles are concise (<60 chars) and start with verbs
- âœ“ Descriptions use Linear's markdown (checkboxes, code blocks, tables)
- âœ“ Estimates follow Linear's point scale
- âœ“ Labels follow team's naming conventions
- âœ“ Issues are sized for single cycle completion
- âœ“ Dependencies are explicitly mapped
- âœ“ Includes Linear-compatible branch naming suggestions

## Special Linear Features to Utilize
- **Triage**: Mark issues needing review with `needs-triage` label
- **SLAs**: Flag customer-impacting issues with `sla:urgent`
- **Roadmap**: Tag strategic initiatives with `roadmap` label
- **Templates**: Suggest issue templates for common patterns
- **Automations**: Note workflow triggers (e.g., "When moved to In Review, notify QA")
- **Integrations**: Include GitHub branch names and PR templates

   - "@mention" for team notifications
3. Format dates as ISO-8601 for Linear compatibility
4. Suggest Linear views:
   - Kanban board by status
   - Timeline by milestone
   - List by priority
5. Include cycle velocity calculations based on estimates
