0) Document Control
Version: v1.2 (adds feature‑control guardrails and fixes per‑language scope)
Owner: Engineering Excellence
Approvers: Security, Platform, Product, Compliance
Stakeholders: IC Devs, Tech Leads, SREs, QA, DX, Risk/Legal
Status: Draft → ready for Phase 0 rollout
1) Scope
In‑scope (v1):
Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python
Environments: Development & Staging
Repositories: up to 3 active pilot repos concurrently, each ≤ 200k LOC
DevOps: GitHub-first with Linear.app integration, strict TDD gates, RBAC + multi‑tenancy, MCP tools
Out‑of‑scope (v1):
Go/Java (deferred to v2)
Direct production merges by agents
Secret rotation & infrastructure provisioning
Org‑wide enablement beyond the pilot repos
2) Overview
Problem: Engineering teams spend ~40 % of their development time on code maintenance, refactoring, and technical debt management. Inconsistent code quality standards across teams lead to increased defects and slower delivery.
Who: Individual contributors, tech leads, SREs, QA engineers, engineering managers, security & compliance.
Value (targets over pilot repos): Mean time to recovery (MTTR) ↓ 50 %; PR cycle time ↓ 30–35 %; test coverage on touched code ↑ 20 + percentage points; technical debt hotspots reduced monthly.
Autonomy (v1): Agents propose and implement PRs behind strict guardrails (Fix Packs and TDD enforcement). Human review is required for any merge. Feature‑level changes require explicit approval.
Constraints: GitHub and Linear as the primary control plane, strict TDD, enterprise security & compliance, RBAC & multi‑tenancy, automated machine‑readable documentation, and MCP tool integration.
3) Business Requirements (SMART)

8) Logical Dependency Chain
MCP tools setup → 2. Agent framework → 3. GitHub/Linear integration → 4. Assessment capability → 5. Execution engine → 6. Pipeline monitoring → 7. Orchestration layer → 8. Learning system → 9. UI/dashboard.
9) DevOps & TDD Policy (GitHub‑first)
9.1 Branch Protection
Required status checks: linting, types, tests, security scans, mutation smoke, FIL classification, Linear sync.
Required reviews: At least one human reviewer for all agent PRs; FIL‑2/3 PRs require FEAT‑APPROVED from a Tech Lead and a Product Owner.
No direct pushes to main; merging only via PR.
9.2 CI/CD Workflows
assess.yml: Scheduled or manual trigger for AUDITOR scans and Linear backlog creation.
execute.yml: Processes Linear tasks, applies Fix Packs via EXECUTOR, runs tests (unit + mutation smoke), and creates PRs.
monitor.yml: Monitors CI/CD pipeline via GUARDIAN, runs auto‑remediation, triggers rollbacks if needed.
learn.yml: Runs weekly pattern extraction and validation via SCHOLAR.
policy.yml: Runs FIL classifier and policy checks on every PR.
9.3 TDD Gates
Red-Green-Refactor enforcement: Each change must progress through [RED], [GREEN], [REFACTOR] commits (or PR labels if squashed). PR templates require linking to failing test and passing test commits.
Diff coverage ≥ 80 % on changed lines; at least one test references changed functions or lines.
Mutation smoke ≥ 30 % on changed files with StrykerJS (JS/TS) or mutmut (Python); time‑boxed to 3–5 minutes; waiver requires reviewer approval.
Test locality: Tests must target changed code and ensure behavior remains unchanged (except for intended fix).
9.4 Acceptance (SMART)
100 % of agent PRs must satisfy TDD gates and policy checks.
All agent‑generated PRs follow the defined TDD pattern and Fit within Fix Packs or have FEAT‑APPROVED for higher impact changes.
10) RBAC & Multi‑Tenancy
10.1 Requirements (SMART)
TEN‑01: Repository isolation – Agents operate only within assigned repository boundaries.
RBAC‑01: GitHub team‑based permissions are inherited by agents; roles defined below.
LINEAR‑01: Workspace‑level isolation for task management; tasks stay within assigned workspace.
AUDIT‑01: Complete audit trail per tenant/repository, including FIL classification and approvals.
10.2 High‑Level Design
Identity: Each organization installs the GitHub App; user OAuth tokens used for actions requiring personal context.
Authorization: GitHub team permissions and Linear workspace membership control access; policy engine ensures agents operate within their scope.
Data isolation: Repository‑scoped data; no cross‑repo access without explicit permission.
Enforcement: API gateway checks every request against GitHub/Linear permissions; denies operations outside allowed scope.
10.3 Permission Matrix
Role	Scope	Can Read	Can Write (PR only)	Can Admin	Notes
Admin	Organization	✓	✓	✓	Configure agents, manage settings
Developer	Repository	✓	PR only	—	Review & merge agent PRs
Agent	Repository	✓	PR only	—	Cannot merge
Viewer	Repository	✓	—	—	Read‑only access

Security Vulnerabilities: Continuous dependency scanning (CodeQL, Semgrep); SBOM generation and signing; secret scanning; regular audits.
Pattern Overfitting: SCHOLAR must validate patterns on blinded evaluation sets; patterns expire or revalidate periodically.
False Negatives in Feature Impact Classification: Use conservative classification; default to FIL‑2/3 when uncertain; allow overrides from human reviewers.
Approval Latency: Provide high‑signal RFC templates; integrate Slack notifications to speed up approvals; limit approver pool.
