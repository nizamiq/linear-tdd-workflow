Begin implementing the identified improvements immediately. Follow this systematic execution plan:

### EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

#### Immediate Execution Priority

**Start with these task categories in order:**

1. **P0 Quick Wins (Do First - Under 2 hours each)**
   - Begin with all tasks marked as P0 and XS/S effort
   - Focus on: removing dead code, fixing naming, extracting constants
   - Run tests after EACH change to ensure nothing breaks
   - Commit each fix separately with message: `[XXX] Brief description`

2. **Critical Security/Bug Fixes (Do Second)**
   - Implement any security-related improvements
   - Fix any identified bugs that could cause runtime errors
   - Add defensive code where missing

3. **High-Impact Refactoring (Do Third)**
   - Start with the highest impact/lowest effort ratio tasks
   - Focus on code that is most frequently modified or critical to the application
   - Create small, incremental commits

### IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

For each task you implement:

1. **Pre-Implementation Check**
   - Confirm the task ID from assessment: [XXX]
   - Verify no blocking dependencies
   - Check if tests exist for the code being modified

2. **During Implementation**
   - Make the minimal change needed to complete the task
   - Don't expand scope - note additional improvements for later
   - Follow the exact implementation steps from the assessment
   - If a task is more complex than estimated, pause and document why

3. **Post-Implementation Validation**
   - Run all related tests
   - If no tests exist, create basic tests first (even if not perfect)
   - Verify the success criteria from the assessment
   - Update CODE_CHANGES.md with:
     ```
     ## [XXX] Task Title
     - Status: âœ… Complete
     - Files Modified: [list files]
     - Tests Run: [pass/fail status]
     - Notes: [any deviations from plan]
     ```

### EXECUTION RULES

1. **Atomic Commits**: One task = one commit (with rare exceptions for tightly coupled changes)

2. **Test Continuously**: Run tests after every single change, not just at the end

3. **Stop Conditions**: Pause and report if:
   - Any test fails after a change
   - A task takes 2x longer than estimated
   - You discover the task affects more than 5 files
   - You find a critical bug while implementing

4. **Progress Reporting**: After every 5 tasks or 2 hours of work, provide:
   - Tasks completed: [list with IDs]
   - Current code quality metrics (if measurable)
   - Any blockers encountered
   - Estimated time to complete current sprint
   - Any new issues discovered

5. **Dependency Handling**:
   - If you encounter a task that depends on another, skip it and mark it as blocked
   - Create a dependency note in CODE_CHANGES.md
   - Continue with the next available task

### TODAY'S EXECUTION TARGETS

Complete these specific categories by end of session:
1. All P0 tasks marked as XS effort
2. At least 50% of P0 tasks marked as S effort
3. Any critical security fixes regardless of effort
4. Create tests for any modified code lacking coverage

### AUTOMATION WHILE YOU WORK

As you implement, also:
1. Add linting rules to `.eslintrc` or equivalent to prevent regression
2. Update pre-commit hooks if you find a pattern that should be checked
3. Document any patterns in a `CODING_STANDARDS.md` file
4. Add automated checks to CI/CD pipeline configuration

### OUTPUT EXPECTED

After this execution session, provide:

```markdown
# Clean Code Execution Summary

## Completed Tasks
- [XXX-001] âœ… Renamed variables in auth.js (5 min)
- [XXX-002] âœ… Extracted magic numbers in config (10 min)
- [List all completed tasks with actual time taken]

## In Progress
- [XXX] ðŸ”„ 50% complete - [describe status]

## Blocked Tasks
- [XXX] â›” Blocked by [reason]

## Metrics Improvement
- Lines of code reduced: X
- Cyclomatic complexity reduced: X â†’ Y
- Test coverage increased: X% â†’ Y%
- Linting warnings reduced: X â†’ Y

## New Issues Discovered
- [Description of any new issues found during implementation]

## Next Session Priorities
- [Ordered list of next tasks to tackle]

## Rollback Points
- Safe to merge: [list of stable commit hashes]
- Requires review: [commits that need human review]
```

### BEGIN EXECUTION NOW

Start with the first P0/XS task from the assessment. Implement it completely, test it, commit it, then move to the next task. Continue until you've completed all immediate priority items or reached a stop condition.

Report progress every 5 completed tasks or if you encounter any blockers.

Focus on velocity while maintaining safety - we want rapid, incremental improvements that don't break anything.

GO! ðŸš€
