# 1. Executive Overview

## Problem Statement
Engineering teams spend 40-60% of their time on maintenance tasks, technical debt management, and repetitive code quality improvements. This reduces velocity on feature development and increases time-to-market for new capabilities.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Individual Contributor Developers
- **Secondary**: Tech Leads, SRE Teams, QA Engineers
- **Tertiary**: Engineering Managers, Security Teams, Compliance Auditors

## Value Proposition
The Linear TDD Workflow System delivers measurable engineering efficiency gains through:
- **40% reduction** in maintenance time through autonomous Fix Pack execution
- **50% faster** Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) via automated pipeline recovery
- **30-35% improvement** in PR cycle time through pre-validated changes
- **20+ percentage point increase** in test coverage on touched code

## Autonomy Level
**Level 2 - Guided Automation**: System proposes changes via PRs with full documentation, test evidence, and risk assessment. Human approval required for merge. Autonomous execution limited to sandboxed environments.
